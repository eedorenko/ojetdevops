Each item is either an instance that duck types Validator, or is an Object literal containing the properties listed below. Implicit validators created by a component when certain attributes are present (e.g. required attribute), are separate from validators specified through this attribute. At runtime when the component runs validation, it combines the implicit validators with the list specified through this attribute. Hints exposed by validators are shown in the notewindow by default, or as determined by the 'validatorHint' property set on the display-options attribute. When validators property changes due to programmatic intervention, the component may decide to clear messages and run validation, based on the current state it is in. Steps Performed Always The cached list of validator instances are cleared and new validator hints is pushed to messaging. E.g., notewindow displays the new hint(s). Running Validation if component is valid when validators changes, component does nothing other than the steps it always performs. if component is invalid and is showing messages when validators changes then all component messages are cleared and full validation run using the display value on the component. if there are validation errors, then value property is not updated and the error is shown. if no errors result from the validation, the value property is updated; page author can listen to the valueChanged event to clear custom errors. if component is invalid and has deferred messages when validators changes, it does nothing other than the steps it performs always.
